		  Bledsoe we weave personal, educational, historical, social,
		  and scientific commentary. At the time we write, Bledsoe is
		  an active contributor to science and education at the
		  University of Texas at Austin. We hope that our fondness
		  for Bledsoe, whom we have known well for twenty-three
		  years, has not clouded our assessment of his many
		  achievements. We are certain that we have failed to treat
		  adequately many aspects of Bledsoe's life prior to our
		  first meeting him in 1966, and sadly fear that lack of
		  space and lack of investigative effort cause us to omit
		  quite a few interesting aspects of his career since then.
		  We hope, however, that this short sketch of Bledsoe will
		  please his friends and perhaps provide some useful
		  information for a future biographer or historian of
		  science.",
